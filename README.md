I have built many Machine Learning models/pojects which I have uploaded here on my github profile. 
Currently I am working on some more Machine Learning projects.
I am also doing online Machine Learning course as well.
Along with machine learning I work on enhancing my data structures and algorithms skill using C++ language. 
Here are some links to check my programming ability:
